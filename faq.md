## Frequently asked questions

#### Do I need to be enrolled at a university to attend?

No! The course is open to all participants. 

#### What is the course code?

During registration, you may need to enter the course code: *H09*.

#### What level of Haskell knowledge do you expect?

You should be comfortable reading simple Haskell function definitions
of functions -- such as map and filter -- and understand the basics of
pattern matching and algebraic data types. There are many good
resources available introducing these basics -- feel free to contact
the lecturers if you're unsure about your prerequisites.

### How will the sessions be run?

We will (most likely) use MS Teams for our lectures, together with
labs hosted virtually in gather.town. We will send an email with more
information to all registered participants in June.
