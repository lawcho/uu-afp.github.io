      <h2><a href="https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~keller/">Gabriele Keller</a></h2>

      <p>
        Since writing her first functional program, an Emacs mode in
        Elisp, as a first year student, Gabriele has been fascinated
        by the concept of functional programming. Moving on to
        strongly typed languages like Haskell, she did her PhD on
        parallel functional programming. Since then, she has been
        active in the Haskell research community and has contributed
        to a number of Haskell high-performance libraries. She has
        been teaching programming language theory and practice at
        University of New South Wales, Sydney since early 2000.

      <h2><a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~swier004">Wouter Swierstra</a></h2>

      <p>Wouter first learned Haskell as an undergraduate in 1999 in
      Utrecht. After completing his degree, he went on to do a PhD
      about functional programming languages at the University of
      Nottingham. After a brief stint in industry and various post-doc
      positions, he is now an assistant professor at the University of
      Utrecht.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://www.ost.ch/de/person/farhad-d-mehta-1860">Farhad Mehta</a></h2>

      <p>Farhad Mehta belongs to a generation that made its first
      programming experiences in a functional language, and secretly
      grieves over the passing of those times. He believes that
      functional programming has the potential to make software less
      complex and more fun to write. He has worked in this area at
      INRIA in Paris (the home of Coq), TU Münich (the home of
      Isabelle/HOL), and the ETH Zürich. He is currently Professor of
      Computer Science at the OST Eastern Switzerland University of
      Applied Sciences, where he, among other things, teaches
      Functional Programming and co-organizes the yearly ZuriHac
      (zurihac.info) conference since 2017.</p>
