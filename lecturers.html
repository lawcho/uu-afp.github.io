      <p>
      Johan wrote his first functional program in 1987, when
      still an undergraduate.  He wrote a PhD thesis on the algebra of
      programming, and went on to develop various kinds of generic
      programming approaches in Haskell, first in Gothenburg, Sweden,
      and later in Utrecht. He is now a professor of software
      technology for learning and teaching, and he uses functional
      programming techniques to develop various kinds of intelligent
      tutoring systems and serious games.</p>
