## Labs

Each set of exercises cover a set of related topics from the lectures.

* [Monads, transformers, applicatives](as1.html)
* [Type-level programming](as2.html) (GADTs, generic programming)
* [Tools and laziness](as3.html)
* [A simple database](as4.html) (parsing, monads, I/O validation)
* [Lambda calculus](LambdaCalculus.hs)

### Even more exercises

We have collected a lot of different exercises related to Functional Programming
in Haskell in a [big PDF](assignments.pdf). The exercises are categorized
by difficulty level and topic. Feel free to work on any of them, and ask
any question that may arise during the lab sessions.
