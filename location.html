<h2>Location</h2></br>

The summer school will be held in the <em>Buys Ballot Gebouw</em>
(Buys Ballot Building) on the Utrecht Science Park, <em>De
Uithof</em>. 

<h3>Getting here</h3>

When traveling by public transportation from Utrecht Central Station
to the Uithof, you can take either bus 12 to bus stop Padualaan or bus
28/128 to bus stop Botanische Tuinen. At both stops, you should be
able to see the following buildings just beyond the bus stop.

 The Buys Ballot Gebouw is the large building with the large
<em>Universiteit Utrecht</em> logo on the roof. 


<h3>Public transport</h3>

Although you can pay for your bus tickets on the bus, it might be a
good idea to purchase an <em>OV chipkaart</em> which lets you pay by
swiping your card. Fares are typically a bit cheaper when paid with
a <em>chipkaart</em> as opposed to cash on the bus. You can find more
