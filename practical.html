<h2>Practical information</h2></br>

<p>Due to the pandemic, we have decided to run the school online using
MS Teams and Gather.town. A few weeks before the school starts, we
will reach out to the participants with further information.</p>


<!-- <p>The summer school will be held in the <em>Buys Ballot Gebouw</em> -->
<!-- (Buys Ballot Building) on the Utrecht Science Park, <em>De -->
<!-- Uithof</em>. </p> -->

<!-- <p>We will confirm the exact room numbers closer to the summer school -->
<!-- date.</p> -->

<!-- <h3>Getting here</h3> -->

<!-- When traveling by public transportation from Utrecht Central Station -->
<!-- to the Uithof, you can take tram number 22 to the Science Park (De -->
<!-- Uithof). You will need to purchase a ticket before boarding the -->
<!-- tram. If you get off at the <em>Padualaan</em> stop, you should be -->
<!-- able to see the following buildings nearby. -->

<!-- <p> The Buys Ballot Gebouw is the large building with the large -->
<!-- <em>Universiteit Utrecht</em> logo on the roof. </p> -->

<!-- Note that you cannot enter the building directly. You may need to -->
<!-- enter through the Minnaert building (the low red building in front of -->
<!-- the Buys Ballot Building) or the Koningsberger building (the glass -->
<!-- building to the right of the Buys Ballot Building). -->

<!-- <h3>Public transport</h3> -->

<!-- To use public transport in the Netherlands you will need an <em>OV -->
<!-- chipkaart</em> which lets you pay by swiping your card. You can find -->
<!-- more -->
<!-- <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/everything-about-travelling/different-types-of-passenger/tourists.htm">information -->
<!-- about the OV chipkaart online</a>. -->
