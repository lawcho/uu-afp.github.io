#### General

The *Applied Functional Programming* summer school has been running
for more than eight years. We aim to educate aspiring Haskell
programmers beyond the basic material covered by many textbooks.

The lectures will cover several more advanced topics regarding the
theory and practice of Haskell programming, including topics such as:

* lambda calculus;
* monads and monad transformers;
* lazy evaluation;
* generalized algebraic data types;
* type families and type-level programming.

The summer school consists of a mix of lectures, labs and a busy
social program. You may want to check out the preliminary
[schedule](schedule.html) to get some idea of what to expect.

The school will run from August 26&ndash;30, 2019.

#### For whom

We expect students to have a basic familiarity with Haskell
already. You should be able to write recursive functions over
algebraic data types, such as lists and trees. There is a great deal
of online material freely available that covers this material. If
you've already started learning Haskell and are looking to take your
functional programming skills to the next level, this is the course
for you. Or if you're used to working in functional languages such as
Scala, PureScript, Elm, OCaml, or Racket, and looking to learn more
about foundations and Haskell -- you may want to consider joining our
summer school.

#### Venue

The lectures and labs will be held on the Utrecht Science Park (also
known as *de Uithof*) in the BBL building. Many of the social events
will be in the city center, but there are regular buses and you might
want to consider renting a bicycle.

#### Costs

* €1700 - Course, course materials and housing
* €1500 - Course and course materials 

This registration fee should cover almost all of your expenses in the
entire week. All lunches, coffee, and dinners will be covered.

If you are a student or affiliated with a university, we can offer a
€1000 euro discount on your registration fee.

If you are keen to attend the summer school, but unable to finance
your stay, you may contact the organizers. We have a limited number of
scholarships available to provide further financial support.
